<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>

Your task is to build a model<sup>1</sup> which can predict y-coordinate.  
You can pass tests if predicted y-coordinates are inside error margin.

You will receive train set which should be used to build a model.  
After you build a model tests will call function <code>predict</code> and pass x to it.

Error is going to be calculated with

Blocked libraries: <i>sklearn, pandas, tensorflow, numpy, scipy</i>

Explanation  
[1] <i>A mining model is created by applying an algorithm to data, but it is more than an algorithm or a metadata
container: it is a set of data, statistics, and patterns that can be applied to new data to generate predictions
and make inferences about relationships.</i>
